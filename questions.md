> What is .gitignore file for?

    The .gitignore file is a text file that tells Git which files or folders to ignore in a project.

    A local .gitignore file is usually placed in the root directory of a project. You can also create a global .gitignore file and any entries in that file will be ignored in all of your Git repositories.

    To create a local .gitignore file, create a text file and name it .gitignore (remember to include the . at the beginning). Then edit this file as needed. Each new line should list an additional file or folder that you want Git to ignore.

> What's the difference between compiled and interpreted language?

    In the compiling scenario the entire program source code is conveted first, before any compute can run it. This way entire programm is already transleted into binary form ready to CPU to execute it. 
    Interpreting scenario you send your original source code for which the interpretive goes through one line at a time converting each line to binary equivalent and then executing that line immediately before moving on to the next one.
